I am a PhD. scholar at <a href="http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in">Department of Aerospace Engineering</a>, <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in">IIT Madras</a>.
I work with [Prof. R. I. Sujith](http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/~sujith/) on data driven modeling of thermoacoustic systems.
Severe conditions within thermoacoustic systems (combustors) limits the number of observed variables.
We work on integrating tools from nonlinear dynamics and machine learning algoriths to model thermoacoustic systems.
Despite the focus on thermoacoustic systems the poposed frame work readily applies to varety of dynamical systems.

I also enjoys scientific computing.
My master's thesis was on LES simulation of methae-air flame for slot stabilized burner under the guidance of [Prof. Santosh Hemchandra](https://aero.iisc.ac.in/people/santosh-hemchandra/). The objective of the study was to understand the effect of oscillation of mixture compostion and on flame extinction and validation of the solver.

I am a avid programmer who likes to reproduce visually appealing patterns such as fractals and ray tracing.
Apart form mechanical sciences, I also engross in learning computer science, electronincs and machine learning. 

I go for long distance running, cycling and recently completed full (42 km) <a href="https://www.thechennaimarathon.com">Chennai marathon 2025</a>.
I engage myself in technical activities such as building a computer, carpentry and scooter repair.
