I am a PhD. candidate at <a href="http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in">Department of Aerospace Engineering</a>, <a href="https://www.iitm.ac.in">IIT Madras</a>.
I work with [Prof. R. I. Sujith](http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/~sujith/) on data-driven modeling of thermoacoustic systems.
Severe conditions within thermoacoustic systems (combustors) limit the number of observed variables.
We work on integrating tools from nonlinear dynamics and machine learning algorithms to model thermoacoustic systems.
Despite the focus on thermoacoustic systems, the proposed framework can be readily applied to a variety of dynamical systems.

I also enjoy scientific computing.
My master's thesis focused on LES simulation of a methane-air flame for a slot-stabilized burner, under the guidance of [Prof. Santosh Hemchandra](https://aero.iisc.ac.in/people/santosh-hemchandra/). The objective of the study was to understand the effect of oscillation on mixture composition and flame extinction, and to validate the solver.

I am an avid programmer who enjoys recreating visually appealing patterns, such as fractals and ray tracing.
Apart from mechanical sciences, I am also engrossed in learning computer science, electronics, and machine learning. 

I go for long-distance running, cycling, and recently completed the full (42 km) <a href="https://www.thechennaimarathon.com">Chennai marathon 2025</a>.
I engage in technical activities such as building computers, carpentry, and scooter repair.
